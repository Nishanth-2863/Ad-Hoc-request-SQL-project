# Atliq Hardwares - Data Analytics SQL Challenge

## üöÄ Project Overview

**Domain:** Consumer Goods  
**Function:** Executive Management

Atliq Hardwares is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India with a strong presence in international markets. Despite its success, the management observed that they lack sufficient insights to make data-driven decisions in real-time. To address this gap, they decided to expand their data analytics team by hiring junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, the Data Analytics Director, initiated an SQL challenge to assess candidates' technical and soft skills.

The challenge revolves around analyzing the sales and product data of Atliq Hardwares, using **SQL** to extract meaningful insights. The goal was to evaluate how well the candidates can handle data, structure queries, and provide actionable insights from the given database.
